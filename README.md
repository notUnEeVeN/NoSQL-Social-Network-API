## Description

This is the 18th Module project for the 18th week of the UCB Coding bootcamp, this week we focused on creating a database for an elementary social networking website using MongoDB. For this project we were given no starter code, and told to create a code using the Mongoose package, express, node, and I also used the moment package to add precise date and time stamps into the database, so that user 'reactions' or 'thoughts' were time stamped.

## Installation

Have MongoDB installed, the package.json file contains all other necessary packages, so running npm install is the only other necessary step. 

## Usage 

After starting the MongoDB, and running npm install, you can either seed the database with preset data (random filler data has been filled in the utils folder) by running npm run seed, or luanch the database, and begin adding your appropriate data by hand by using insomnia, or another similar database manager.
